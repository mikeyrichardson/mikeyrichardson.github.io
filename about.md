![Teaching Multivariable Calculus]({{site.url}}/images/TeachingMVC.jpg)
Since moving to San Francisco six years ago, I have taught high school math at Los Altos High School. Three years ago, I started their AP Computer Science program. Teaching Java made me realize how much I enjoy programming and now I have decided to pursue a career in data science.

During the past year, I have independently studied many topics in data science in preparation for a career transition.
