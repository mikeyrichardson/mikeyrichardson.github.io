![Teaching Multivariable Calculus]({{site.url}}/images/TeachingMVC.jpg)
Since moving to San Francisco six years ago, I have taught high school math at Los Altos High School. During that time, I introduced AP Computer Scince, Multivariable Calculus, and Linear Algebra to the school's curriculum. Teaching computer science allowed me to hone my programming skills and made me realize how much I enjoy the field. Now I have decided to merge my love of math with my love of programming and pursue a career in data science.

During the past year, I have independently studied many topics in data science in preparation for a career transition. Following is a summary of the topics I studied.

* Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course
* John Hopkin's Data Science Specialization
* Michael Nielsen's Neural Network and Deep Learning book
* Stanford's Mining Massive Datasets course

Currently, I do most of my work in python and have used Kaggle competitions to gain experience with numpy, pandas, and scikit-learn.
