Since moving to San Francisco six years ago, I have taught high school math at Los Altos High School. During that time, I introduced AP Computer Scince, Multivariable Calculus, and Linear Algebra to the school's curriculum. Teaching computer science allowed me to hone my programming skills and made me realize how much I enjoy the field. Now I have decided to merge my love of math with my love of programming and pursue a career in data science.

During the past year, I have independently studied the following topics in data science in preparation for a career transition.

* Logistic regression, neural networks, support vector machines, clustering, PCA, recommender systems, Matlab programming (Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course)
* Exploratory data analysis, statistical inference, R programming (John Hopkin's Data Science Specialization)
* Stochastic gradient descent and backpropagation in neural networks, activation functions, regularization, momentum, convolutional neural networks (Michael Nielsen's Neural Network and Deep Learning book)
* Numpy, ipython, pandas, scikit-learn, decision trees, keras, lasagne, pylearn2 (Kaggle competitions)
* MapReduce, hadoop, page rank, frequent itemsets, graphs (Stanford's Mining Massive Datasets course)
* Pig, hive (O'Reilly books)
