I taught high school for 7 years and loved it. Here's a picture that my linear algebra students made for me during my last year teaching. Apparently taking secret pictures of me when I turned around was more interesting than my lecture (inconceivable).

Now I'm spending most of my time learning as much as I can about data science and looking forward to the next phase of my career.

When I'm not studying, I'm walking around in the mountains, swimming, singing, or playing piano. And eating ice cream.
