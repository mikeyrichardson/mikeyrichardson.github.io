title: Algebra Scale Program
---
Almost every algebra student has heard the analogy of an equation and a scale. Some might have even moved little tokens around on a small, plastic scale that didn't have any moving parts. I wanted students to be able to practice on a scale that did move. That way, if you forget to do an operation to "both sides of the equation," you will immediately know something is wrong because the scale won't be balanced anymore. That immediate feedback is the whole reason I created the Algebra Scale Program.

I originally wrote the Algebra Scale Program because I wasn't completely happy with any of the software currently available. There are some similar programs that use a scale, but in those programs, the scale doesn't move. As a result, students don't realize they're doing something incorrectly. Experience has taught me that if students don't get timely feedback to correct mistakes early on, they just end up getting better at doing things the wrong way.

The program also allows the input of any algebraic integer equation (instead of relying only on the preprogrammed equations). This way, teachers and students can do simpler or more complex equations if desired.
