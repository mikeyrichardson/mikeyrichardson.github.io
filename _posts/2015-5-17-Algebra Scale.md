title: Algebra Scale Program
---
I originally wrote the Algebra Scale Program because I wasn't completely happy with any of the software currently available. There are some similar programs that use a scale, but in those programs, the scale doesn't move. As a result, students don't get immediate feedback when they do something incorrectly. My experience has taught me that if students don't get timely feedback to correct mistakes early on, they just end up getting better at doing things the wrong way.

I also wanted a program that would allow the input of any algebraic integer equation (instead of relying only on the preprogrammed equations). That way, teachers and students can do simpler or more complex equations if desired.
